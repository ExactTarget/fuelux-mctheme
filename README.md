# Marketing Cloud Theme

The Marketing Cloud Theme is a single stylesheet that should be included after [Fuel UX](https://getfuelux.com) and Bootstrap.

This theme enables a first-class user experience for your applications that seamlessly fits into the [Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud](http://www.exacttarget.com/) platform and strives to offer visual parity with the previously released, [Internet Marketing Hub Theme](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux-imhtheme) with support for [Fuel UX 3](http://exacttarget.github.io/fuelux/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).

##Philosophy and authors

### The Fuel UX Philosophy
Our aim is to provide a suite of related but independent projects that help web developers integrate, manage, and customize quality libraries and utilities to more efficiently develop, maintain, test, and distribute their projects.  Any improvements or fixes we make to the open source projects, we use will be contributed upstream if they are useful to the rest of the community.
